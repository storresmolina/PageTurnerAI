PageTurnerAI is an intelligent musician‚Äôs assistant that listens to your performance in real time, tracks your progress through sheet music, and automatically turns the page at just the right moment.

## ‚ú® Why PageTurnerAI?

Musicians often struggle with the same challenge:  
- How do you flip a page while keeping both hands on your instrument?  
- How do you practice with digital scores without breaking your flow?  
- How do you get real-time feedback on accuracy without a teacher at your side?

PageTurnerAI solves these problems by combining **Optical Music Recognition (OMR)** and **real-time audio tracking** to follow along as you play. No pedals, no gestures, no assistants ‚Äî just you and your music.

## üì≤ How It Works

1. **Upload Sheet Music**  
   Choose a PDF from your device. PageTurnerAI analyzes the file and extracts note data using Optical Music Recognition.

3. **Hands-Free Page Turns**  
   When you approach the end of the page, the app predicts the best turn moment based on your tempo and seamlessly flips for you.

4. **Review Your Session**  
   After playing, view a summary of your performance: notes hit correctly, places where you slowed down, and suggestions for practice.
